This webpage scrapes information about LA's weather from Weather-And-Climate just so you can complain about it like a true Los Angelino!


Created to show students:

> (1) How to webscrape with Cheerio
> 
> (2) How to set up super basic authentication
> 
> (3) How to use Handlebars

Students no longer learn Cheerio in class, however, and are taught alternative forms of authentication, so I've deactivated the link to live.

All the same, it comes in handy for showing MVC set up with Handlebars.
